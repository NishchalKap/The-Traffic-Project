## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms

#### Traffic Optimization
```python
def optimize_traffic_signals(self, traffic_data):
    # 1. Calculate priority scores for each intersection
    priority_scores = self._calculate_priority_scores(traffic_data)
    
    # 2. Apply fairness constraints
    adjusted_scores = self._apply_fairness_constraints(priority_scores)
    
    # 3. Determine optimal signal states
    optimized_signals = self._determine_signal_states(traffic_data, adjusted_scores)
    
    return optimized_signals
```

#### Emergency Detection
```python
def _detect_emergency_flashers(self, camera_data):
    # Analyze red/blue light patterns
    red_range = max(red_vals) - min(red_vals)
    blue_range = max(blue_vals) - min(blue_vals)
    
    # Detect pulsing patterns characteristic of emergency vehicles
    has_peaks = (max(red_vals) > threshold and max(blue_vals) > threshold)
    pulsing = (red_range > pulse_threshold and blue_range > pulse_threshold)
    
    return has_peaks and pulsing
```
